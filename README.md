# CodexNovas

CodexNovas is a modern React web application bootstrapped with **Vite**, optimized for fast development and high performance. This project uses **ESLint** for code linting and is structured to support scalable development.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

CodexNovas serves as a foundational frontend template, likely intended for showcasing products, content, or web interactions with multimedia. It uses modern tooling including:

- **React** (via Vite)
- **Vite** (for fast bundling and HMR)
- **ESLint** (for maintaining code quality)
- **Modular CSS & Assets** (for styling and visuals)

## 🧠 Internal Notes

- Main logic begins in `src/main.jsx`, rendering the `<App />` component.
- All static images are stored in the `public/` folder and accessible via root-relative paths (e.g., `/image1.png`).
- Styling is split between global styles (`index.css`) and component styles (`App.css`).
- Linting rules are defined in `eslint.config.js` to enforce code standards.

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues or Limitations

- No backend integration or API logic included.
- Assets in `src/assets/` are currently unused.
- No routing or state management (like React Router or Redux) configured.
- The app structure is minimal — best suited for template/demo purposes unless expanded.
